Herewith, I've attached all the necessary QP_model0 files required in the deployment phase of SpareWare'20.

Attached files include:


necessary_imports: This is NOT requirements.txt but does include a list of all imports needed by the QP algorithm to work. requirements.txt should include all these packages

QP_functions: All necessary functions needed to implement QP algorithm

model_files: All the model weights needed by the project (.pkl format)

data_files: All the data that is needed by the model to predict (.pickle format). Does NOT include the final dataset
